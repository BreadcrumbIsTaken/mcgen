# mcgen

## Generate a Minecraft server in seconds!

Generates a server with [Paper](https://papermc.io) and optionally [BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/1-8-1-15-bungeecord.392/). This tool will auto generate a simple start script (start.sh/start.bat depending on what OS you use) or one with [Aikar's Flags](https://aikar.co/mcflags.html).

## How to use!

Simply install it using:

```
cargo install mcgen
```

then you just have to use a super easy command:

```
mcgen gen your_servers_name_here
```
